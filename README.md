<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project  
Easily my largest project is Tonality, a fully developed social website. Tonality has a wide range of features, all centering around allowing users to share their musical interests, find new music, and share their opinions. I developed Tonality completely by myself, with feedback from two of my close friends, one of which had the original idea for the site.   

### Built With
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
* [Core PHP](https://www.php.net/)
* [mySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Creating an Account
To start using Tonality, a user just needs to visit [gotonality.com](http://gotonality.com) and navigate to the [signup page](http://gotonality.com/signup). Creating account is very straightforward: You'll be asked for your name, preferred username, email, password, and profile image. Tonality also has a 'remember me' feature, which will save your encrypted login information to a cookie and automatically login you in next time you visit the page. Once you create your account, you are ready to begin using Tonality!    
If a user ever wants to change any of their information, they can visit their profile and update their name, email, usernanme, or passowrd at any time.

### How does Tonality work?
At its core, Tonality aims to be a social network for music lovers. Everytime you visit the website, you are met with a main feed of music recommendations, specifically tailored to you using the Spotify API. While the API is used, a user does not need a Spotify account to use the site. Rather, their previously rated music on Tonality is used to get new recommendations. At the top of the page, a user can find the menu bar, which allows the to navigate through the sites main functions:
* **Home:** The home page of Tonality is the landing page. Here, the user can find our main function, the infinite recommendation feed. A user can scroll through this page and listen to new music using the Spotify Widget, rate the music, and continue to scroll as long as their heart desires. Above the feed, there is a slide set of newly released music, which uses the Spotify API to update itself as new music comes. Finally, the user can switch to an alternative following feed, which will show them the music that their friends have been rating, commenting on, and pinning.
